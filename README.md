# Convert Document To Speech

A Next.js learning project that explores text-to-speech conversion capabilities. Built as part of my journey learning Next.js and modern web development practices.

## Description

This project represents my first dive into Next.js development, featuring a clean interface for text-to-speech conversion. The application includes user authentication through Clerk and utilizes modern UI components. Key features implemented so far:

- User authentication with Clerk
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Modern UI components from Shadcn
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk (Authentication)
- Shadcn UI (Components)
- Lucide React (Icons)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and Install:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd my-app
    npm install
    ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
    Create a `.env.local` file with your Clerk keys:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
    ```

3. **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Current Features
